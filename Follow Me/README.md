# Udacity-Follow-Me-Project


Overview

The project aims to identify a target in an environment which is simulated and then track that target. One of the main steps would be to train a deep neural network to understand that simulated scene and also understand the target. 

This project has many applications in Robotics, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and can also be used automotive industry for simple applications such as advanced cruise control. The simulated environment scene has a target moving and UAV that is trying to follow the person. 

The aim is to train the neural network in to understand the scene and understand the target, location of the target, maintain the distance with the target means to move the UAV closer or farther away from the target as necessary.
